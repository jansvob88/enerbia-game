Abandoned project used to learn C# basics and OOP

There is nothing much to do except to move around the map using arrow keys.

I used this project to learn very basics of C# and OOP, creating objects, working with arrays, loops, conditions, etc.

12 classes, 3000 lines
C#, OOP, no commentary, unfinished methods
